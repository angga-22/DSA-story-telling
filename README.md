## 🎮 Sample Adventure Experience

Here's what makes this project special - **every algorithm tells a story!**

### 🏴‍☠️ Example: Pirate's Treasure Hunt (Sliding Window)

```python
# Instead of boring technical explanation:
# "Find longest subarray with sum <= k"

# You get an epic adventure:
def longest_treasure_hunt(treasures, max_weight):
    """
    🏴‍☠️ PIRATE'S PROBLEM:
    You're a pirate with treasure values: [3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5]
    Your ship can carry up to 8 gold pieces at once.
    What's the LONGEST stretch of treasures you can collect?

    🧠 STRATEGY: Use expanding & shrinking window!
    """

            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
```

### 🎪 **Our Adventure Approach:**

```python
def perfect_pair_treasure_hunt(treasures, target_gold):
    """
    💰 THE TREASURE HUNT:
    You're a treasure hunter with gold values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11]
    The ancient map says you need exactly 10 gold pieces.
    Find TWO treasures that add up to exactly 10!
